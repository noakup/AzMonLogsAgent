; this file is used by ownership enforcer to determine reviewers to add to a pull request
; you can add comments using ; as prefix
; introduce each owner in a separate line with their alias (not email address)
; prefixing an alias with * means that the owner will not be automatically added as a reviewer to pull requests to reduce noise, but can still be manually added and can sign off if necessary
; to learn more you can read https://onebranch.visualstudio.com/OneBranch/_wiki/wikis/OneBranch.wiki/5644/Enabling-Ownership-Enforcer
;
; example (pretend the following lines are not commented):
;
;    alias     is an owner alias. Only one alias per line is accepted.
;    ;         starts a comment line. It is only accepted at the beginning of a line.
;    *         before an alias indicates an owner who won't be added to any pull request automatically. Please note that this flag is not supported for Security Groups.
;    @         before an alias indicates a non-owner who has to be added to all pull requests automatically.
