// Get total number of minutes of streams recorded per participant in each call.
// For Transcription, Streams would be defined as and calculated per call as follows:
//  Total number of minutes streamed in each session between a start request and stop request/call-end/error.
//      or joining and leaving events per participant in that session.
//      eg: In a single call,
//          if streaming session (1) was 10 minutes participant (a) and (b) were in that session;
//          if streaming session (2) was 05 minutes participant (b) and (c) were in that session;
//          if streaming session (3) was 07 minutes participant (a), (b) and (c) were in that session;
//          then the total minutes per participant would be: 
//              participant (a) = 17 minutes,
//              participant (b) = 22 minutes,
//              participant (c) = 12 minutes
