This folder contains documentation files that are no longer actively maintained but are preserved for historical reference.

## üìã Contents

### **Implementation Documentation (Superseded)**
These files documented various implementation phases and are now superseded by the current codebase:

- `ENHANCED_EXAMPLES_COMPLETE.md` - Enhanced examples feature implementation notes
- `ENHANCED_LOADING_GUIDE.md` - Loading system guidance (outdated)
- `ENHANCED_TABLE_DISPLAY_COMPLETE.md` - Table display implementation notes
- `EXAMPLES_ENHANCEMENT_SUMMARY.md` - Examples enhancement summary

- `INDENTATION_ISSUE_RESOLVED.md` - Code formatting issue resolution
- `RETRY_ENHANCEMENT.md` - Retry mechanism enhancement notes

### **User Guides (Superseded by Main README)**
These guides have been consolidated into the main README.md:

- `WEB_INTERFACE_GUIDE.md` - Web interface user guide

### **Development Notes**
- `PR_DESCRIPTION.md` - Pull request description template/notes

### **Superseded Code Files**
- `nl_agent.py` - Previous version with results explanation features (moved 2025-09-14)
  - *Note: This version had additional OpenAI explanation capabilities but lacked example browsing*
  - *The current nl_agent.py (formerly nl_agent_fixed.py) focuses on core functionality with example browsing*

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Notes**

- **These files are archived for reference only**
- **Do not rely on information in these files for current functionality**
- **Refer to the main `README.md` and `PROJECT_SUMMARY.md` for up-to-date documentation**
- **Current examples and metadata are in the root directory `app_*` files**

## üóëÔ∏è **Future Cleanup**
These files can be safely deleted if historical reference is not needed. They contain no active functionality or current documentation.
